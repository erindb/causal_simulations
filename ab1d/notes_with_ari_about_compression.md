"if i say cause, what will you think?"  utterance --> "thing"
i want you to think "the right thing".

prior on worlds --> transformation to causal representaiton
and then maybe smooth it?

maybe the speaker wants the listener to know how much is cause true?

goal of speaker is to choose an utterance so that its sub-function (literal listener) will choose an output that is similar to my input.
